## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd xktradingfloor
```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in `vite.config.js`).

**Note**: All npm commands must be run from within the `frontend/` directory.

### Build for Production

npm run build:prod
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `frontend/docs` directory (for GitHub Pages) or `frontend/dist` directory.
